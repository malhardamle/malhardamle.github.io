        <li>The most interesting and complex html assignment that I have worked on so far in my career, has been revamping a webpage to enable better teleoperation of autonomous robots, this project involved many style changes to the UI/UX of the page as well as working on understanding how the design of a web page can lead to unintentional biases</li>
        <li>The main thing I hope to learn from this class is to be able to create an entire project from start to finish, meaning being able to design a front end website as well as create a functioning backend. </li>
        <li>Yes, I have signed up for the Piazza forum!</li>
