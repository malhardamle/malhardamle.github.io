        <li> While working on this assignment, one challenge I came across was trying to get the github SSH key on my computer. This was a little tricky, but ultimately I was able to get it working by using the given instructions as well as online resources to guide me.</li>
           <li>I learned how to publish my work/project via Github pages. I had already worked with HTML before, therefore I understood the basic tags and how to create the basic documents</li>
           <li>The most useful resources were the github assignment 1 instructions along with Google for publishing pages via Github and getting the SSH key setup</li>
